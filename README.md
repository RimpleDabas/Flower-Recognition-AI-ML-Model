# Flower-Recognition Model
In this project our is to train Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) for flower recognizion and built a flask based app for it. 
## Data collection
The data for testing and training our model were collected from three sources
 - Web scraping from Google Images
 - API requests from Flickr 
 - API request from Pixabay

## Data Cleaning 
- This step involved getting rid of junk images such as drawings, flowers tyagged in wrong categories etc. This was done manually. After cleaning we raanged flowers folderwise so as to use them fol labeling in the preprocessing steps. The combined data is located here()
